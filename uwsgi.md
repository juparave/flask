### Expanding variables/placeholders [ref](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ParsingOrder.html)
After the internal config tree is assembled, variables and placeholder substitution will be applied.

The first step is substituting all of the $(VALUE) occurrences with the value of the environment variable VALUE.

```ini
[uwsgi]
foobar = $(PATH)
```
foobar value will be the content of shellâ€™s PATH variable

The second step will expand text files embraced in @(FILENAME)

```ini
[uwsgi]
nodename = @(/etc/hostname)
```
nodename value will be the content of /etc/hostname

The last step is placeholder substitution. A placeholder is a reference to another option:

```ini
[uwsgi]
socket = :3031
foobar = %(socket)
```
the content of foobar will be mapped to the content of socket.
